# 🚀 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT - QUICK START

**You're ready to test locally! No more push-to-production cycle.**

---

## ⚡ Fastest Way to Start

### Option 1: Simple Start (Recommended)
```bash
./run-dev.sh
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

---

## 📊 Watch Logs While Testing

**Terminal 1:** Run Forge
```bash
./run-dev.sh
```

**Terminal 2:** Watch filtered logs
```bash
./scripts/watch-logs.sh forge-dev.log
```

Or use tail directly:
```bash
tail -f forge-dev.log | grep -E "═══|✅|❌"
```

---

## 🔄 After Making Code Changes

### Quick Rebuild
```bash
./scripts/rebuild.sh
```

### Manual Rebuild
```bash
make build
pkill forge
./bin/forge > forge-dev.log 2>&1 &
```

## 🐛 Debug the "0 Conversations" Issue

### Step 1: Start Forge
```bash
./run-dev.sh
```

### Step 2: In another terminal, watch logs
```bash
tail -f forge-dev.log | grep "CONVERSATION\|tabID="
```

### Step 3: Execute your command card
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Run your configured command card with "Trigger AM" checked

### Step 4: Check logs immediately
```bash
# Did it trigger?
grep "COMMAND CARD TRIGGER" forge-dev.log | tail -5

# Was conversation created?
grep "CONVERSATION STARTED SUCCESSFULLY" forge-dev.log | tail -5

# Can we retrieve it?
grep "GetConversations() returned" forge-dev.log | tail -5

# Tab ID consistency?
grep -E "tabID=|/conversations/" forge-dev.log | tail -10
```

### Step 5: Run diagnostic test
```bash
./test-am-robust-logging.sh
```

This will tell you exactly what's wrong!
